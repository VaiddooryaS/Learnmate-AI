1. Developed an end-to-end AI pipeline that ingests PDFs/YouTube videos, extracts audio via yt-dlp, and performs multilingual transcription using Whisper for accurate text generation.

2. Implemented an abstractive summarization engine using the BART transformer to convert long transcriptions into concise, context-preserved summaries.
   
3. Built an intelligent keyword extraction and study-aid generator using KeyBERT and NetworkX to automatically create flashcards, mind maps, and conceptual diagrams from processed text.

4. Integrated multilingual translation and assessment modules using GoogleTrans/MarianMT, NLTK, and Gemini API to automatically translate notes and generate/evaluate quizzes with real-time performance charts.

5. Engineered a modular Streamlit interface that orchestrates the entire workflow—uploading, transcription, summarization, visualization, and quiz evaluation—into a seamless, user-interactive learning tool.
